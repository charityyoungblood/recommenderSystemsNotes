<!-- Product Association Recommenders -->

1. As Non-Personalized Recommendations lack "context" - with Product Association Recommenders, we are looking at the very SPECIFIC context of a product or small set of products that a customer is currently looking at or consuming, as an example of a way to constrain what is recommended

2. Product Association Recommenders deal with Ephemeral, Contextual Personalization
  - The products are recommendation based on what you are "currently" shopping for or putting in your cart 
  - Your current navigation is a reflection of your current interest 
  - It is personalized, but NOT personalized to the individual's LONG-TERM tastes and preferences - ONLY personalized to your CURRENT interest
