<!-- Demographics and Related Approaches - For "Loosely/Weak Personalized Recommenders" --> 

1. Why use Demographics?
  - Popularity may not represent the taste of the target user in your application
    - i.e. if the most popular music is for 15 year olds, a 40 year old man may not see that recommendation as valid
  - Demographic attributes include:
    - Age 
    - Gender
    - Race/Ethnicity
    - Socio-Economic Status 
    - Location
  - If I can label users, who we know little about, with certain attributes, can I do a better job making recommendations  for the items they would like by identifying what's popular in THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC
