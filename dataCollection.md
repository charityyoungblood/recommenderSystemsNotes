<!-- Where does the data that drives Recommender Systems, come from? How is it collected? -->  

Learning Objectives for Preferences and Ratings (Lesson Title)
  - Understand what data Recommenders can use to learn what users like 
  - Identify types of data collected from users 
  - Understand when different data types are possible and appropriate 
  - Be able to identify types of preference data likely used in a system 


1. In order to do recommendation of ANY form, you need to have data about what items users are likely like, or what items go together 

2. Though there are exceptions, many systems collect this data from their users 

3. When collecting data, it is important to know WHAT you are trying to learn > With Recommender systems, we are trying to learn PREFERENCE - we want to learn, WHAT users like 
  - PREFERENCE is used broadly 
  - Users display their PREFERENCES in a number of ways. Theses ways can be split into two categories 
    - Explicit Actions: where the user is taking an action for the purpose of telling either the system or other users of the system what they think about a particular item 
      - Rating
      - Review
      - Vote
    - Implicit Actions: the user is NOT telling anything, but through their actions we can determine what they think about a particular item
