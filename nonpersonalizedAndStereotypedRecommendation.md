<!-- Non Personalized and StereoTyped Recommendations -->

1. Why Do We Want Non-Personalized Recommendations?
  - Effective for NEW USERS; since we don't know a lot about them, we CANNOT provide a PERSONALIZED recommendation
    - However, we still can make recommendations for products, that the new user will find useful and actionable 
  - Nonpersonalized recommendations are very efficient and relatively fast to compute - (i.e. "How many people bought this item") 
  - They can provide a lot of benefit as far as sales, and the user finding the kinds of items they need
  - Non-Personalized recommenders in this case, can provide a very good return on investment
