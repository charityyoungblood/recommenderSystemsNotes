<!--What is the Output of a Recommender System?--> 

Learning Objectives for Predictions and Recommendations (Lesson Title)
  - To understand the ways in which Recommender output can be used 
  - To understand the distinction between predictions and recommendations 
  - To understand the distinction between organic and explicit presentation 
  - To review examples and understand which presentation makes most sense in different applications 
  
1. Predictions
  - In many Recommender Systems, what is being computed, is an estimate of how much you will like an item, how likely you are to purchase an item, or some other numeric score that is supposed to correlate with your opinion of an item
  - If a prediction is wrong, WAY OFF, i.e. it predicted you would like yellow sneakers, and you HATE yellow sneakers, than you are more likely to distrust future and other predictions from the Recommender system 
  
2. Recommendations
  - Recommendations DO NOT make the bold statement that predictions do
  - Recommendations are SUGGESTIONS of things you MIGHT like, things that "fit" what you're doing right now
  - Recommendations are displayed in "lists", i.e. "Top 5" or "Top 10" 
  - Recommendations can also be displayed to the user by item (without the list)
  
3. What are the pro's and cons of Predictions vs. Recommendations?
  - Often the two come together
  - Predictions
    - Pro: they can help quantify item 
    - Con: they can provide something falsifiable 
  - Recommendations
