<!-- Analyzation and Classification of Recommender Systems (Taxonomy) -->

Learning Objectives for Taxonomy of Recommenders (Lesson Title)
  - To understand the different types of Recommender Systems
    - A framework for analyzing Recommender Systems in general 
    - A specific overview of different recommendation algorithms 
  - To acquire a roadmap for the rest of the course, based on algorithms studied 
  
1. Analytic Framework - 8 Dimensions of Analysis  
  a. Domain: What's being recommended? What is the content that is being recommended?
    - News, text, articles  
    - Products, vendors, bundles 
    - Matchmaking (recommending people to other people)
    - Sequences (i.e. music playlists) - not just the "set" of songs, but do the "order" of those songs may also matter
    - Interesting property of Domains - the way we treat items that have already been experienced (i.e. music player - we may mostly use music you've heard before, or groceries - that you have already eaten)
      **Examples of Domains for Education and/or Building Community**
        - TripAdvisor - community
        - OWL Learning Tips - education
        - ReferralWeb - expertise finder (education)
    - In some Domains, we are primarily interested in recommending NEW items  
    - Google is a form of Recommender - it is "recommending" websites based on search term 
  b. Purpose: in some cases, the purpose for recommendation is simple - it is an end in itself - We want you to BUY or CONSUME or otherwise take up the recommendation that we give you 
    - In other cases, the recommendations are aggregated as a form of education or a form of building community, and understanding whether recommendations are just come in and consume or are they part of a larger purpose helps us to tailor the recommender for the user's needs 
  c. Recommendation Context: What is the user doing at the time of recommendation? How does that context constrain the Recommender?
    - Depending on what the user is currently doing and who they are with, will affect the level of attention or the degree to which the user will accept an interruption via recommendation
  d. Whose Opinions: Whose opinion is the Recommender based on?
    - Experts, everybody, people like you? - it's usually a mix of all of these
    - Recommender systems, in the broad sense, are based on somebody's opinion, sometimes only yours, but more often other people's opinions as well 
  e. Personalization Level: 
    - Generic/Non-Personalized - NO PERSONALIZATION - everybody gets the same recommendation  
    - Demographic - Could semi-personalize by attaching a recommendation to a certain demographic  
    - Ephemeral - Temporary personalization, by matching to your current activity 
    - Persistent 
  f. Privacy and Trustworthiness: In many cases, people want to know, WHO has to know WHAT about me in order for me to use this Recommender? 
    - How much personal information is needed?
    - Does it have to know the user's identity?
    - Can I use it anonymously?
    - Is there a way I can DENY some of those preferences? - there may be things that were purchased or liked by the user, that they DO NOT want others knowing or associating those purcahses with themselves 
    - Is the Recommender System honest? 
    - How much has the operator "built in" biases? - sometimes these biases are referred to as "Business Rules" 
    - In some cases, the business rules/biases make lots of sense and are consumer friendly 
      - For example, some recommender systems will NOT recommend items that are out of stock 
      - Another example, is a recommender would NOT recommend an item from another store or vendor 
    - Another aspect people are worried about is, vulnerability to a Recommender to external manipulation
    - Transparency of Recommenders - and the degree of which the individuals giving us data have a reputation that will allow us to trust them
