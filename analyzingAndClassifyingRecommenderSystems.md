<!-- Analyzation and Classification of Recommender Systems (Taxonomy) -->

Learning Objectives for Taxonomy of Recommenders (Lesson Title)
  - To understand the different types of Recommender Systems
    - A framework for analyzing Recommender Systems in general 
    - A specific overview of different recommendation algorithms 
  - To acquire a roadmap for the rest of the course, based on algorithms studied 
  
1. Analytic Framework - 8 Dimensions of Analysis  
  a. Domain: What's being recommended? What is the content that is being recommended?
    - News, text, articles  
    - Products, vendors, bundles 
    - Matchmaking (recommending people to other people)
    - Sequences (i.e. music playlists) - not just the "set" of songs, but do the "order" of those songs may also matter
    - Interesting property of Domains - the way we treat items that have already been experienced (i.e. music player - we may mostly use music you've heard before, or groceries - that you have already eaten)
    - In some Domains, we are primarily interested in recommending NEW items  
    - Google is a form of Recommender - it is "recommended" based on search term 
  b. Purpose: in some cases, the purpose for recommendation is simple - it is an end in itself - We want you to BUY or CONSUME or otherwise take up the recommendation that we give you 
    - In other cases, the recommendations are aggregated as a form of education or a form of building community, and understanding whether recommendations are just come in and consume or are they part of a larger purpose helps us to tailor the recommender for the user's needs 
  c. Recommendation Context 
  d. Whose Opinions
  e. Personalization Level 
  f. Privacy and Trustworthiness 
  g. Interfaces 
  h. Recommendation Algorithms
